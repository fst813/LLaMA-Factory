This could be due to various reasons such as issues with the boot order in the BIOS, or problems with the bootable devices themselves. The system also experienced a warm reset, which is a type of reboot that does not clear the system's RAM, but it does reset the system's state. This could be a response to an error or a management action. The timestamp clock sync was asserted, indicating that the system's clock was successfully synchronized.
