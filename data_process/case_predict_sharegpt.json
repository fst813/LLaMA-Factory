It shows a failure detected and AC lost, indicating a possible power supply failure or disconnection. This is a critical issue as it can affect the entire system operation. The system also detected that the AC out-of-range but present, suggesting that there might be an issue with the power supply's ability to handle the AC input. The processor status showing presence detected and asserted indicates that the processor is operational, but this is not the main issue based on the provided logs. The rest of the logs indicating system ACPI power state and presence detection being asserted suggest normal operational status. Therefore, the main issue to address is the power supply failure or disconnection as indicated by PS1_Status."
